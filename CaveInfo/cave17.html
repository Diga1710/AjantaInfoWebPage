<h2>Information About Cave 17 </h2>
<h4> Cave 17 – A Masterpiece of Mahayana Narrative Art </h4>
<p>
	Ajanta Cave 17, constructed in the late 5th century CE under the Vakataka dynasty, is a richly decorated Mahayana Buddhist vihara known for its elaborate murals and symbolic sculptures. Functioning as both a monastic residence and a teaching center, the cave exemplifies the blend of artistic excellence and spiritual devotion. It was likely funded by local rulers and wealthy patrons aiming to promote Mahayana values.
</p>
<p>
	The architectural plan includes a large rectangular hall with four rows of beautifully carved pillars, a veranda supported by octagonal columns, and multiple monk cells. At the rear lies a shrine containing a seated Buddha in dharmachakra mudra, flanked by Bodhisattvas like Padmapani, symbolizing compassion and wisdom. The carvings on pillars and doorframes feature floral patterns, guardian figures, and mythological motifs, reflecting the artistic richness of the Gupta period.
</p>
<p>
	Cave 17 is especially celebrated for its murals, which depict Jataka tales—stories from the Buddha’s past lives. These vibrant paintings use natural pigments and exhibit dynamic human figures, emotional expressions, and complex compositions. The themes range from moral teachings and royal life to spiritual scenes, serving as visual scriptures for monks and pilgrims.
