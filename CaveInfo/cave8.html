<h2>Information About Cave 8 </h2>
<h4> Cave 8 – Early Hinayana Simplicity and Silence</h4>
<p>
	Cave 8 is among the earliest Ajanta excavations, dating to the 2nd century BCE during the Hinayana phase. It represents the ascetic lifestyle of early monks and is a plain vihara without any sculptures, paintings, or elaborate architecture. The rectangular hall includes small meditation cells cut into the rear and side walls, each with stone benches. No shrine or Buddha image exists, in line with early Buddhist aniconism.
</p>
<p>
	Today, Cave 8 is partially buried and damaged due to water seepage and erosion. Despite its worn state, it offers crucial insight into the origins of Buddhist monastic life at Ajanta, emphasizing simplicity, meditation, and detachment from material display.
