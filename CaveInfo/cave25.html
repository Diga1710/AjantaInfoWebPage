<h2>Information About Cave 25 </h2>
<h4> Cave 25 – A Chaitya-Type Cave Without a Stupa </h4>
<p>
	Cave 25 is a chaitya-type cave, meaning it was designed as a prayer hall, but no central stupa or Buddha image exists inside. It has a semi-circular apse, side aisles, and barrel-vaulted ceiling, characteristic of earlier chaityas like Cave 10 and 19.
</p>
<p>
	Its architectural layout suggests it was designed for communal worship, possibly with the intention of installing a stupa or statue later, but it was left unfinished. The cave may have been repurposed or abandoned before its completion. It remains important as an example of evolving religious space planning during the late Mahayana period.
