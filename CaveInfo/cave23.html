<h2>Information About Cave 23 </h2>
<h4> Cave 23 – An Incomplete Cave with Grand Intentions </h4>
<p>
	Ajanta Cave 23 is an unfinished Mahayana vihara, slightly larger than Cave 22, and located between Caves 22 and 24. Although the excavation was incomplete, the initial layout includes a veranda, pillared hall, and shrine chamber.
</p>
<p>
	Some of the pillars and doorframes show partially carved motifs, including floral designs and rough outlines of guardian figures. The shrine contains a Buddha figure, also in early carving stages. Cave 23 reflects the ambitious plans for spiritual and architectural development that were halted midway, likely due to political changes or resource constraints.
