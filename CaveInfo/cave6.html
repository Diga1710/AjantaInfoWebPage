<h2>Information About Cave 6 </h2>
<h4>Cave 6 – The Two-Storied Sanctuary of Innovation</h4>
<p>
	Cave 6 is Ajanta’s only double-storeyed monastery, demonstrating advanced architectural experimentation. Its lower level was begun around 460 CE, with the upper added later—possibly around 465 CE after Cave 5 was abandoned. The lower floor includes a large hall, shrine with Buddha in teaching posture, and extensive narrative reliefs like the Shravasti Miracle and Mara’s Temptation.
</p>
<p>
	The upper level, though incomplete, includes additional prayer chambers and another shrine. Notably, the upper Buddha image is accompanied by a kneeling devotee—an early example of personalized worship. The cave features rich carvings of divine beings, animals, and narrative motifs. Despite its hurried execution and partial finish, Cave 6 symbolizes a pivotal moment in Mahayana devotion and spatial complexity.
