<h2>Information About Cave 21 </h2>
<h4> Cave 21 – An Early Mahayana Vihara with Pillared Hall </h4>
<p>
	Cave 21 is a large Mahayana vihara, showcasing early developments in monastic architecture. The interior features a spacious rectangular hall supported by twelve massive rock-cut pillars, each with carved floral motifs. Along the walls are side cells used by monks for meditation and rest.
</p>
<p>
	At the rear is a shrine with a seated Buddha, flanked by Bodhisattvas and divine figures, indicating its devotional purpose. Though relatively plain compared to the highly ornate caves, Cave 21 includes traces of mural work and narrative scenes. It strikes a balance between functionality and devotion, illustrating the growing integration of sacred imagery into everyday monastic life.
