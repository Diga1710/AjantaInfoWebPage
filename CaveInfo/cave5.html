<h2>Information About Cave 5 </h2>
<h4>Cave 5 – The Most Elegant Vihara</h4>
<p>
	Cave 5 is a small, unfinished vihara located between Caves 4 and 6. Initial excavation began around 465 CE but was halted early due to structural issues in the rock. It was briefly reattempted after Emperor Harishena’s death by local patrons (possibly the Asmakas), but again abandoned in favor of nearby Cave 6.
</p>
<p>
	The only completed feature is its finely carved doorframe, adorned with mythical creatures like makaras and female figures. No cells, shrine, or paintings exist inside. Though modest, Cave 5’s partial construction and decorative doorway suggest it once had artistic potential and reflect shifting patronage and practical challenges during Ajanta’s expansion.
