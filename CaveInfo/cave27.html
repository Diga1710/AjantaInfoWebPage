<h2>Information About Cave 27 </h2>
<h4> Cave 27 – A Small and Incomplete Vihara </h4>
<p>
	Cave 27 is incomplete, located adjacent to Cave 26. It appears to have been designed as a vihara, but excavation was halted before much progress was made. Only a portion of the hall and some side walls were carved.
</p>
<p>
	Some structural elements may have later been integrated into Cave 26. Today, Cave 27 serves more as an archaeological footnote, reminding us of the ambitious scope of Ajanta’s development, much of which remained unrealized due to shifting patronage and political changes.
