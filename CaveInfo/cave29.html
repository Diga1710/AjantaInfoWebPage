<h2>Information About Cave 29 </h2>
<h4>  Cave 29 – A Planned Chaitya, Never Completed </h4>
<p>
	Cave 29 is a rare, unfinished chaitya located between Caves 20 and 21. Only the early stages of excavation—such as the cutting of the entrance and some side walls—were undertaken. No pillars, stupa, or interior carvings are present.
</p>
<p>
	Its design closely follows the chaitya layout, indicating it was intended as a prayer hall, possibly similar to Cave 19 or 26. However, the cave never progressed beyond the planning phase. It remains significant as an architectural draft, offering insights into the construction process of rock-cut sanctuaries.
