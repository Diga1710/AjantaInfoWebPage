<h2>Information About Cave 2 </h2>
<h4>Cave 2 – Emphasis on Femininity and Devotion</h4>
<p>
	Cave 2, adjacent to Cave 1, was built around the same time but shows better preservation. It emphasizes feminine spiritual themes and may have been commissioned by a royal woman, possibly linked to Emperor Harishena’s court. The structure mirrors Cave 1 in design, featuring a square central hall, elaborately carved columns, and a sanctum housing a Buddha image.
</p>
<p>
	The murals depict tales of compassion and motherhood, such as the Hariti goddess, once a demoness, transformed into a protector of children. Other painted narratives include the Shravasti Miracle and various Jataka tales. The artwork is filled with symbolic representations of women as nurturers and moral figures. The spiritual, social, and artistic feminine expression makes Cave 2 unique within the Ajanta complex.
