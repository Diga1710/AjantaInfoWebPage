<h2>Information About Cave 14 </h2>
<h4> Cave 14 – An Incomplete Mahayana Vihara </h4>
<p>
	Cave 14, located just above Cave 13, is an unfinished Mahayana vihara from the 5th century CE. Though incomplete, its architectural plan indicates a larger and more decorative structure was envisioned. The cave includes a wide hall, partially excavated monk cells, and space for a central shrine, though the shrine was never completed. The partially carved pillars and early attempts at decorative motifs reflect the Mahayana intent of combining residence with ritual function.
</p>
<p>
	Traces of Bodhisattva figures near the entrance and incomplete interior carvings suggest the plan for rich iconography. Cave 14 marks a transition from early Hinayana austerity to the Mahayana focus on devotion and symbolism, even though the final artistic vision was never realized.
