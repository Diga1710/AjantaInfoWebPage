<h2>Information About Cave 15 </h2>
<h4> Cave 15 – A Functional Mahayana Monastery with a Shrine </h4>
<p>
	Cave 15 is a modest but complete Mahayana vihara, built in the 5th century CE. It represents the gradual shift from purely residential caves to spaces that incorporated devotional worship. Architecturally, the cave includes a veranda with octagonal pillars, a central square hall supported by four pillars, and eight monk cells. At the rear lies a shrine chamber housing a seated Buddha in dharmachakra mudra, flanked by Bodhisattvas.
</p>
<p>
	The cave features symbolic carvings on doorframes and modest exterior decorations. Although its paintings are mostly faded, traces of floral and geometric designs suggest it was once more richly adorned. Cave 15 is a key example of how functional monastic spaces evolved to include Mahayana devotional practices.
