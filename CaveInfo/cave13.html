<h2>Information About Cave 13 </h2>
<h4> Cave 13 – A Pure Hinayana Monastic Retreat</h4>
<p>
	Ajanta Cave 13 dates back to the 2nd century BCE and belongs to the Hinayana phase of Buddhism. It is a simple vihara (monastic residence) created for meditation, renunciation, and self-discipline. Designed with minimalism, the cave reflects the early Theravāda ideals that prioritized inner spirituality over ritual or decoration. The structure includes a small rectangular hall with a modest veranda supported by two square pillars, and five monk cells carved into the side and rear walls.
</p>
<p>
	There are no pillars inside, no central shrine, and no ornamentation. The cave lacks murals, sculptures, or images of the Buddha, as early Buddhists discouraged anthropomorphic representations. Cave 13 stands as a silent symbol of non-attachment, solitude, and the practical design of early Buddhist architecture.
