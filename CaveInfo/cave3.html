<h2>Information About Cave 3 </h2>
<h4>Cave 3 – The Abandoned Monastery</h4>
<p>
	Cave 3, also known as the Abandoned Monastery, is less ornate than its neighbors but holds significant historical value. It features a large prayer hall with a stupa at the rear, surrounded by monastic cells. The simplicity of its design reflects the austere lifestyle of the monks who once inhabited it.
</p>
<p>
	Though devoid of decorative elements, its archaeological significance is high. It reveals early quarrying techniques, incomplete chisel marks, and planning strategies of ancient cave excavators. Cave 3 stands as a raw, behind-the-scenes look at the practical and material limitations encountered during Ajanta’s golden age of construction.
