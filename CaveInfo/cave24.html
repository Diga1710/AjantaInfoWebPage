<h2>Information About Cave 24 </h2>
<h4> Cave 24 – One of the Largest and Most Ambitious Viharas </h4>
<p>
	Cave 24 is an enormous Mahayana vihara, second only to Cave 4 in scale. Its grand size and spacious layout indicate it was intended as a major monastic center. The cave includes a wide hall supported by massive pillars, multiple monk cells, and a shrine with a seated Buddha in teaching posture.
</p>
<p>
	Though incomplete, many carved elements like floral designs, guardian figures, and Bodhisattvas are visible, suggesting it was meant to be richly ornamented. Cave 24 represents the zenith of Mahayana architectural ambition at Ajanta, although it remained unfinished likely due to the decline of Vakataka patronage.
