<h2>Information About Cave 10 </h2>
<h4> Cave 10 – The Oldest Painted Chaitya</h4>
<p>
	Cave 10 is the oldest cave at Ajanta, dating to the 2nd century BCE, and it’s also a chaitya-griha. Its design includes a central nave with side aisles formed by 39 pillars and a prominent stupa at the rear. The vaulted ceiling includes carved stone imitating wooden beams, showing architectural evolution from wood to rock.
</p>
<p>
	Significantly, Cave 10 contains India’s earliest surviving mural paintings, though most are faded. These include Jataka tales and floral designs in tempera, offering a glimpse into the storytelling methods that would flourish in later Mahayana caves. As a space for group worship and chantings, Cave 10 bridges early ascetic practice with emerging artistic expression.
