<h2>Information About Cave 28 </h2>
<h4>  Cave 28 – A Vihara in Initial Stages </h4>
<p>
	Cave 28 is another incomplete vihara, likely started during the late phase of Ajanta’s development. The cave consists of a basic rock-cut opening, and only the rough outlines of the hall and cells were begun before the work was abandoned.
</p>
<p>
	No significant sculpture, shrine, or paintings are found in this cave. Like Caves 23 and 27, Cave 28 reflects disrupted construction, possibly due to the decline of Buddhist patronage or sociopolitical instability.
