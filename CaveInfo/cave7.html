<h2>Information About Cave 7 </h2>
<h4>Cave 7 – Sculptural Devotion in Mahayana Style</h4>
<p>
	Cave 7 is a richly decorated Mahayana vihara from the late 5th century CE, known for its elaborate carvings and architectural complexity. Though smaller than Caves 1 or 2, it stands out due to its ornate pillars, detailed shrine, and multiple subsidiary shrines—unique among Ajanta caves. The rectangular hall is supported by 17 intricately carved pillars, and the sanctum houses a serene seated Buddha in dhyana mudra, resting on a lotus pedestal flanked by lions and Bodhisattvas.
</p>
<p>
	The cave is adorned with sculptures of Avalokiteshvara, Maitreya, and other celestial beings. The absence of murals is compensated by the depth of stone art on ceilings, doorways, and columns. With its twin side shrines and devotional layout, Cave 7 reflects the growing emphasis on collective worship and Mahayana ideals of salvation through compassion.
