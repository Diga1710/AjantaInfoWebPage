<h2>Information About Cave 4 </h2>
<h4>Cave 4 – The Largest and Most Ambitious Vihara</h4>
<p>
	Cave 4 is the largest monastery at Ajanta, measuring approximately 35 × 28 meters, carved on a higher level of the cliff. Sponsored not by royalty but by a wealthy lay devotee named Mathura, it was an ambitious project that ultimately remained incomplete, likely due to poor rock quality and ceiling collapse.
</p>
<p>
	Its design includes a large hypostyle hall with a massive Buddha statue in the sanctum, flanked by Bodhisattvas and celestial beings. The cave was intended to be richly decorated, but only parts like the carved Avalokiteshvara panel and shrine doorframe were completed. Despite its unfinished state, Cave 4 exemplifies both the artistic ambition and engineering difficulties of Ajanta’s final construction phase.
