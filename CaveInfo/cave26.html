<h2>Information About Cave 26 </h2>
<h4> Cave 26 – A Magnificent Mahayana Chaitya with Elaborate Sculpture </h4>
<p>
	Cave 26 is one of the most artistically impressive chaitya-grihas at Ajanta, dating to the late 5th century CE. It closely resembles Cave 19 but on a grander scale. It features a colonnaded hall, a vaulted ceiling, and a large stupa at the end with a seated Buddha in preaching posture, carved into its front.
</p>
<p>
	What distinguishes Cave 26 is its profusion of sculptures. The walls, pillars, and stupa are intricately adorned with narrative reliefs, depicting events from Buddha’s life, such as the Mahaparinirvana (death of the Buddha) and Temptation of Mara. Bodhisattvas, guardian figures, and celestial beings line the walls, reflecting the Mahayana emphasis on compassion and divine protection. This cave stands out as a spiritual and artistic culmination of the Ajanta tradition.
