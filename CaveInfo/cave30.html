<h2>Information About Cave 30 </h2>
<h4>  Cave 30 – Recently Rediscovered, Extremely Incomplete </h4>
<p>
	Cave 30 was rediscovered in the 20th century and is located near Cave 15A. It is considered one of the earliest caves, possibly belonging to the Hinayana phase. The cave is in a very rudimentary stage, consisting only of rough cuts into the rock. It lacks any definitive architectural or iconographic features.
</p>
<p>
	Due to its extreme incompletion, Cave 30 is mostly of archaeological interest, offering a clue into the origins of the Ajanta complex. It suggests that early efforts at cave excavation may have been abandoned or redirected as the complex expanded.
